## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library("showtext")
library("ggplot2")
library("magrittr")
library("reshape2")
library("ggthemes")
library('dplyr')

mydata <- data.frame(
  Lebal  = c("Point1","Point2","Point3","Point4","Point5"),
  xstart = c(5.5,15.7,19.5,37.2,36.9),
  xend   = c(9.7,28.1,24.6,44.6,47.1), 
  ystart = c(9.6,23.1,2.3,33.2,9.2),
  yend   = c(16.1,36.2,11.7,38.5,15.3),
  size   = c(12,48,30,11.5,28),
  class  = c("A","A","A","C","C")
)
ggplot(mydata)+
  geom_rect(aes(xmin = xstart,xmax = xend , ymin = ystart , ymax = yend , fill = class)) +
  scale_fill_wsj()
```
